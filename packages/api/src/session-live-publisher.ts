/**
 * Session live publisher — the ONE discipline for mirroring an in-flight
 * turn onto the per-session event bus, extracted from `routes/chat.ts`
 * so the background lanes (channel pipeline, callee executor) publish
 * with exactly the chat route's throttle/cap/snapshot semantics instead
 * of growing their own (docs/architecture/features/live-work.md §5.2).
 *
 * Two pieces, both lifted verbatim:
 *
 *  - `createTurnStreamPublisher` — the throttled `turn_stream` snapshot:
 *    full reply-so-far (never deltas — a subscriber joining mid-turn has
 *    no missed-prefix gap), ~150ms throttle so a streamed reply can't
 *    NOTIFY-storm the bus, tail caps keeping the payload under the NOTIFY
 *    budget, and the current tool name as `activity` until reply text
 *    flows. When `attribution` resolves, the snapshot also carries the
 *    reasoning tail + sender/assistant ids (rooms; background lanes).
 *
 *  - `publishRoomTurnActivity` — one discrete activity event, mirrored
 *    so every cleared viewer renders the SAME feed the sender sees;
 *    oversized tool inputs degrade to `{}` (the client falls back to its
 *    static label). The `mirror` gate is evaluated by the CALLER per
 *    call. Chat and background lanes mirror throughout so proxy cuts cannot
 *    leave authenticated reconnects without ongoing activity.
 *
 * Publishing is unconditionally safe: the bus is server-side and the only
 * exits are the `gateSessionRead`-gated relays. Do NOT add a "publish
 * only if someone is watching" optimization — presence-conditional
 * emission is a cache-invalidation bug factory; the throttle + the bus
 * coalescer are the cost control.
 *
